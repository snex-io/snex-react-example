# SNEX React Example

This project shows how [SNEX](http://snex.io) can be used together with React. The app creates a session, and a URL for session which is displayed on screen. When a user connects to session it adds an element representing the player and exposes all player input for each player in the DOM.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
